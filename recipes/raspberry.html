    <h3>Description.</h3>
    <p>If you love the idea of chia pudding but do not like the chunky texture, 
      this recipe is for you! Blending chia pudding turns it into a smooth, 
      almost mousse-like texture. <br>
      This one is flavored with juicy, 
      tart raspberries which gives it a dreamy pink color too!

    <h4>Pro-tips.</h4>
    <ul>

      have enough volume for the blender to blend the mixture properly.
      </li>
      <li>Blended chia pudding will keep in an airtight container 
        in the fridge for up to 5 days.
      </li>
      <li>You may substitute monkfruit erythritol sweetener 
        with any other sweetener of choice.
      </li>
      <li>I used soy milk but feel free to use any 
        milk of choice.
