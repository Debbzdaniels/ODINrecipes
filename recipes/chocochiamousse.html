    <h3>Description.</h3>
    <p>
      This chocolate chia mousse tastes exactly like packet chocolate pudding, 
      except it has no refined sugar and is a nutrition power house! <br>Blending the chia mixture means
      there is no need to wait overnight, plus it gets rid of the gloopy chia texture and transforms
      it into a smooth and creamy mousse!
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tbsp chia seeds</li>
      <li>3 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
      <li> 1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
      <li>3 tbsp monkfruit erythritol sweetener</li>
      <li>360ml soy milk</li>
      <li>pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps.</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Place all ingredients in a high-speed blender.<br>
         Blend on high until mixture is completely smooth and creamy,<br> 
        about 1-2 minutes, pausing to scrap down the sides if necessary.</li>
      <li>Transfer to serving glasses and enjoy!</li>  
    </ol>
    <h4>pro-tips</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Straight out of the blender, this chia mousse will have a soft pudding texture.
        If you prefer a firmer mousse, you can leave it in the fridge
        to set for 30 minutes to overnight.</li>
      <li>I used a mixture of maple syrup and monkfruit erythritol sweetener because I like the flavor of this combination for this recipe.
         <br>However, feel free to substitute with any other sweeteners of choice</li>  
      <li>Feel free to substitute soy milk with any other milk of choice.</li>
    </ul>
